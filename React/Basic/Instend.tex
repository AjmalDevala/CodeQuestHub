//What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It helps manage the state of your app in a predictable way,
making it easier to track and update data across different components.

Key Concepts in Redux:

1)Store: The central place where all the application's state lives.
2)Actions: Objects that describe what happened in the app (e.g., user clicked a button).
3)Reducers: Functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state.
4)Dispatch: A method used to send actions to the store.
5)Selectors: Functions that retrieve specific pieces of state from the store.

Common Tools Used with Redux:

Redux Toolkit: A set of tools that simplifies using Redux by providing easy-to-use functions for creating actions, reducers, and the store.
React-Redux: The official binding library for integrating Redux with React, allowing components to connect to the Redux store.
Redux DevTools: A browser extension that helps visualize and debug the state changes in your Redux store.
